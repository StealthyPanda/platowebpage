All Plato data is stored in a `.plato` folder in the root of the project folder. To share any Plato project, all you need to do is share the `.plato` folder.

> **NOTE:** This does not share the actual contents or files of your folder, just the threads and the conversation in those threads, along with the model used, configuration etc.
