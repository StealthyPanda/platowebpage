description: Organisation of information as threads.
---

A thread is a line of thought, and is very similar to how they work with other conversational chatbots such as ChatGPT or Claude.

Each thread represents a single line of thought, and can be used to organise different topics and ideas within the project. You can change the model, temp and tone of a thread at any point during the thread's usage. The current configuration will be used for each subsequent response. However, this configuration is NOT saved along with each response generated. Thus, only the last configuration is saved for future reference.
